<h3> Project Name: </h3>
Personal Site

<h3> Features: </h3>
As for now, its pretty bland honestly, i've made parts of it but i need to make it complete to attach it properly and make it look like an actual site, so its pretty much only: <br>
- about me 
- some of my projects

I was so confused what to include or what not..

<br>

but there is a lot to it yet, i'll be finishing this off in w15.
Thank you!
